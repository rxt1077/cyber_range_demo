  You can run one challenge at a time.
  Once you are ready to switch challenges, stop the running one and the full list will become available again.
  Sessions are limited to 60 minutes after which you will be logged out and your challenge environments will be shut down.
  The time you have remaining is shown in the upper right-hand corner.
  If you wish to update your profile or manually log out, you can do so from the user icon in the upper right-hand corner.
